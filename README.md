# TheLifeGameApp
An iPhone goal tracking app which was meant to explore gamification. This was before SwiftUI, so creating iPhone apps was pretty tricky (I have since used SwiftUI. Big improvement for quick prototypes!). Fun project and I learned a lot about Object Oriented Programming in the process.
